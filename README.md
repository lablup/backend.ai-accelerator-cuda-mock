# backend.ai-accelerator-cuda-mock
A mockup plugin for CUDA accelerators

This plugin deceives the agent and manager to think as if there are CUDA devices.
The configuration follows `cuda-mock.toml` and this file should be placed in the same location of `agent.toml`.

Please refer the sample configurations in the `configs` directory.
